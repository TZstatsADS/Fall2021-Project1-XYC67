### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: Is Man more crucial in the world of Philosophy?
+ This project is conducted by Xueying Chen

+ Project summary: Philosophy is important becuase it can help us think critically. This project is to answer whether man is more important in the History of Philosophy or not. The meaning of Man in Philosophy is defined as human being and huaman nature. From "The Conception of Man in Existential Philosophy", *man is unity and a totality.* The dataset that I use to do analysis is holding at kaggle. It contains about 300,000 sentences and 13 schools. The main techniques that I use to explore the data are WordCloud and Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
